spuk
====

Package manager.
Uses curl to download files from the web. Shouldn't really be called a package manager, since it just logs stuff. You 
download tarballs by executing "spuk nameofURL"(Very basic functionality). It really just makes it easier for you to 
download tarballs off the web and use them on your computer.
